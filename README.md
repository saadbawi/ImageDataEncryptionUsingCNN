# ImageDataEncryptionUsingCNN

Steganography is an art of obscuring data inside another quotidian file of similar or varying types. Hiding data has always been of significant importance to digital
forensics. Previously, steganography has been combined with cryptography and neural networks separately. Whereas, this research combines steganography, cryptography
with the neural networks all together to hide an image inside another container image of the larger or same size. Although the cryptographic technique used is quite simple,
but is effective when convoluted with deep neural nets. Other steganography techniques involve hiding data efficiently, but in a uniform pattern which makes it less
secure. This method targets both the challenges and make data hiding secure and non-uniform.
